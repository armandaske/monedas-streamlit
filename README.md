# 🪙 Coin Flip Simulator

An interactive **Streamlit** web app that simulates coin flips and visualizes the results in real time.  
The user can set the number of flips, run multiple simulations, and observe the probability distribution between heads and tails.

## 🧠 Overview

This app demonstrates how randomness behaves in the long run by simulating repeated coin tosses.  
It uses **Python**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** to calculate and plot the frequency of outcomes, making it a fun and simple introduction to probability concepts.

## 🚀 Features

- Simulate any number of coin flips.  
- Visualize results dynamically as a histogram or bar chart.  
- Display cumulative probabilities as flips increase.  
- Reset and re-run simulations easily.
